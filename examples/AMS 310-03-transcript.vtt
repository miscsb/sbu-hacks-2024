NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh Let's see today, we're going to continue talking about

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.419
<v Speaker 3>some of these discrete distributions, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,3,99,98]}

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:52.209
<v Speaker 2>Uh So we went through some background information, some important

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,94,99]}

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:59.000
<v Speaker 1>definitions the last time um things like defining a random

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,98,99,99,95,99,99,43,99,99]}

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:00.029
<v Speaker 1>variable.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Now you mentioned that variable so that you don't break

NOTE CONF {"raw":[33,94,99,99,99,99,85,91,67,99]}

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:04.250
<v Speaker 3>up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.410
<v Speaker 3>Uh It's a discrete versus continuous.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,48,84,73,99,99]}

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:12.650
<v Speaker 3>Remember our definition of a random variable is a function

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,56,99,93,65,99,51,85,63]}

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.389
<v Speaker 1>that assigned to numerical values to each uh outcome of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,55,70,98,99,96,99,99,99,99]}

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.230
<v Speaker 1>the experiment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,99]}

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:22.669
<v Speaker 3>And then we just went through a few examples and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.569
<v Speaker 3>the first sort of name discrete distribution uh that we'll

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,95]}

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>look at is called the binomial distribution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,99,99,99,99,63,99]}

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:35.199
<v Speaker 3>So we'll look at a few of those.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,51,98,98,99,99,99,99]}

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:36.629
<v Speaker 3>Let's sort of start with that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[35,88,90,99,99,99]}

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:41.349
<v Speaker 1>I wanna show you how to find probabilities using R.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,72,99,94]}

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.730
<v Speaker 2>So we'll do that today and probably get through most

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 3>of these distributions in the chapter before I do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,98,86,99,99,99]}

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.879
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any questions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,61,99,99,99]}

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.110
<v Speaker 3>I everything going well.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51,86,99,99]}

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.489
<v Speaker 1>So it's T A si think are slowly correcting homework.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,60,80,99,60,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.559
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know if they've got too much done,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,80,34,88,90,70,91,99,99,99]}

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:06.599
<v Speaker 3>but um I did post the next homework though.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,56,99,99,99,99,99,91]}

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.500
<v Speaker 3>Not due until I think it, it's February 18th, not

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,98,54,63,99,82,84]}

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:12.919
<v Speaker 1>this Sunday, but the Sunday happened.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,95,72,81,92]}

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.919
<v Speaker 3>So, so that's up there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,94,99,99,99]}

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.479
<v Speaker 3>Um, you can probably do some of those already.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,83,76,99,90,99,99,99,99]}

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Ok.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:23.740
<v Speaker 2>So we've got that cooking first test.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,89,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.229
<v Speaker 1>February 20th, which is how many weeks from today?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,29,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.750
<v Speaker 2>Three weeks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,83]}

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:35.419
<v Speaker 2>I, uh, yes, three weeks.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,99,83,99,95]}

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.789
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes its not that far away.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,51,99,99,99,99]}

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:39.100
<v Speaker 3>I will post some practice tests as we get a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.940
<v Speaker 1>little bit closer.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:41.889
<v Speaker 1>OK?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:50.660
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk of the binomial distribution binomial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,84,98,0,99,90]}

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:51.100
<v Speaker 3>Really?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.630
<v Speaker 3>It has two parameters.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:53.160
<v Speaker 3>OK?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.259
<v Speaker 3>And um and it is your number of independent trials

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,99,56,97,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:04.059
<v Speaker 3>and he is the probability of a success on each

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,97,99,99,99]}

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.089
<v Speaker 1>trial and that stays constant, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.470
<v Speaker 3>That, that's an important thing to realize it sort of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,99,96,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 3>stays constant.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 0>And one of the implications of that when you have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,96,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:21.169
<v Speaker 3>sort of a binomial distribution, you wanna think of it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,0,99,99,98,99,99,99]}

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:26.169
<v Speaker 1>as a case where uh you have replacement in the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,97,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,88]}

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:29.440
<v Speaker 1>sense that you pick an item, then you're gonna sort

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,53,99,99,99,99,99,56,77,99]}

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:30.830
<v Speaker 3>of record it and put it back.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.669
<v Speaker 3>You're not changing the probability of a success from one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,98,99,99,99]}

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 2>job to another.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[0,99,99]}

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.690
<v Speaker 2>OK?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.419
<v Speaker 3>Your random variable X is the number of successes in,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,98]}

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:43.440
<v Speaker 3>in trials.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,99]}

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 3>So you might see this notation in certain variations of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,79,99,99,99]}

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.940
<v Speaker 3>it, you know, interpret this, that X is binomial um

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,95,99,94,67,99]}

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:57.979
<v Speaker 3>where the end trials and the probability of the success

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,83,75,99,99,99,99,99,97,99]}

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.610
<v Speaker 1>is peak.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,92]}

00:03:59.169 --> 00:03:59.619
<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.000
<v Speaker 2>So, so a lot of books have a notation, something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,94,99]}

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:05.419
<v Speaker 2>like that and even software would be something like that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,82,99,99,99,99]}

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:11.759
<v Speaker 1>So I mentioned some of these examples and let's see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,69,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.489
<v Speaker 3>Um So, so a couple of the conditions, you know,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,92,96]}

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.489
<v Speaker 3>the experiment consists of and repeated for new trials.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,89,62,99,99,99,92,99]}

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 3>Um I mentioned this one here, probability of success, it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,98,99,89,99,72]}

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.369
<v Speaker 3>says is the same, the trials have to be independent

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51,32,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:30.390
<v Speaker 3>from each other.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:04:30.989 --> 00:04:31.649
<v Speaker 1>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:04:31.859 --> 00:04:36.000
<v Speaker 3>And then we have this probability mass function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:42.429
<v Speaker 3>Um the probability of, let's say, you know, uh X

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,96,99]}

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.739
<v Speaker 3>being equal to some value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.589
<v Speaker 3>So we might say in here a lot of times

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.130
<v Speaker 3>you'll see notation like this, the probability that your random

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,83]}

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.950
<v Speaker 3>variable X is equal to some value X.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,84,99,99]}

00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:59.600
<v Speaker 1>That's how you wanna interpret that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,88,99,99]}

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:05.089
<v Speaker 2>Um You mind N choose X key to the X

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,23,96,99,99,99,48,94,99,99]}

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 3>times one minus P to the N minus X.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,99,99,97,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:05:08.359 --> 00:05:08.670
<v Speaker 1>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:11.690
<v Speaker 1>So that's the probability mass function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.730
<v Speaker 1>I think we did this example.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:17.529
<v Speaker 1>There are a couple of examples.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,78,99,99,99,99]}

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we did this one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.750
<v Speaker 3>So let's start with this one here today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:30.109
<v Speaker 2>Uh This tells us X is a binomial, N is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,98,98,99]}

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 3>five and P is point two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.179
<v Speaker 3>Use the PM F to find your answers.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,41,99]}

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.959
<v Speaker 1>Uh For these, that will be here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,98,92,99,99]}

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.390
<v Speaker 1>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:45.940
<v Speaker 1>So if we want the probability that X is equal

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,98,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.839
<v Speaker 3>to one, let's set that up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,98]}

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.799
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:05:54.089 --> 00:06:03.700
<v Speaker 2>Uh So probability N is equal to 12, probably X

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,90,99,99,99,83,86,99,99]}

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:04.709
<v Speaker 3>is equal to one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.339
<v Speaker 3>And so we could just straight down the parameters, N

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,68,70,68,95,95,99,99,99,99]}

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.869
<v Speaker 1>is five, P is equal to zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,93,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Point two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:23.470
<v Speaker 3>So this would be 521 times point 2.2 to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,51,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.410
<v Speaker 3>X and then it's one minus P.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.829
<v Speaker 3>So in that case, it would be 0.8 to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:32.730
<v Speaker 1>fourth power.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,98]}

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>OK?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:35.950
<v Speaker 1>So let's see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:39.670
<v Speaker 1>So this would be five, choose one is easy with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,91,99,65]}

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:40.619
<v Speaker 1>five, choose one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:44.359
<v Speaker 1>That's the spot, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,97,98,99]}

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:46.390
<v Speaker 3>Then you can choose one, it just like the top

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,99,99,99,99,53,98,62,99,99]}

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:46.890
<v Speaker 3>number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:54.619
<v Speaker 3>So that would be five times uh 1.2 to the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,99,99,99,99,99,99,95,99,99]}

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.890
<v Speaker 3>first power just right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,98,96,99]}

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:59.489
<v Speaker 3>Like that 1.8 to the fourth power.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,83,99,99,99,99]}

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.839
<v Speaker 3>0.8 to the fourth pound.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,98,65]}

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.119
<v Speaker 3>This is, this is where it's, it's a real good

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,61,31,99,99,99,99]}

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.179
<v Speaker 3>idea to bring your calculators to classes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,98]}

00:07:12.679 --> 00:07:20.670
<v Speaker 1>So now you have zero, 044096.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,96,51,54,98,59]}

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:22.390
<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:22.929
<v Speaker 2>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.640
<v Speaker 1>And then what do you get when you multiply those

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:07:25.649 --> 00:07:27.250
<v Speaker 3>three numbers?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.750
<v Speaker 2>See, I think it's just this number, it's five times

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,99,99,99,99,99,99,65,99,92]}

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.850
<v Speaker 2>point two is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,97,99]}

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:39.690
<v Speaker 3>So, so this is zero point 40, no, Citrus.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,99,99,99,99,99,44,99,40]}

00:07:41.339 --> 00:07:41.899
<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:45.040
<v Speaker 2>So that's finding the probability X is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,96,99]}

00:07:45.049 --> 00:07:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Now, if we wanted the probability X is less than

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.049
<v Speaker 2>three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:52.950
<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:07:52.959 --> 00:07:56.470
<v Speaker 2>So here, well, you have to keep in mind that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,92,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:07:58.179 --> 00:08:00.420
<v Speaker 3>X is the street.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,79,91]}

00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:05.799
<v Speaker 3>So if it's less than three, that means it could

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:08:05.809 --> 00:08:08.549
<v Speaker 3>be two, could be one, could be zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,73,99,99,64,99,98]}

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.149
<v Speaker 3>So, so here we wanna think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,99,99,98,99]}

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.200
<v Speaker 3>All right, so this is equal to the probability, let's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,98,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:08:15.209 --> 00:08:16.859
<v Speaker 1>say X is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,93,99]}

00:08:18.239 --> 00:08:20.950
<v Speaker 2>What's the probability X 51?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[40,99,99,94,89]}

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:25.609
<v Speaker 2>The probability X there's two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[59,99,73,84,99]}

00:08:28.149 --> 00:08:28.769
<v Speaker 2>OK?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:31.769
<v Speaker 1>We did one of these up here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,51,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.960
<v Speaker 3>Um The probability X is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:37.359
<v Speaker 1>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:44.710
<v Speaker 3>Well, that would be 520 and then we would have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,98,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:08:44.719 --> 00:08:50.679
<v Speaker 3>the point two to the zero, let's say 0.8 percent

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,77]}

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.809
<v Speaker 3>plus the probability X is one which I'm just going

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.599
<v Speaker 3>to put in here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

00:08:57.609 --> 00:09:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Zero 0.4096 plus the probability X true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,76,72,99,99,99]}

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:11.729
<v Speaker 2>So that would be five, choose two and we would

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:09:11.739 --> 00:09:19.799
<v Speaker 2>have 0.2 squares plus 0.8.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,72,99,99]}

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.510
<v Speaker 2>Ok.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:37.099
<v Speaker 2>So uh CFI 152, zero, if a then choose zero,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,27,49,99,81,99,71,99,99]}

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:41.289
<v Speaker 3>A two zero is one, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,36,99,99,98,99]}

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.570
<v Speaker 2>We put it in the form you get one 0.2

NOTE CONF {"raw":[48,99,95,48,66,53,44,60,99,99]}

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.299
<v Speaker 1>to the zero is one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:55.950
<v Speaker 3>So this is just point A yeah, plus 0.4096.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,99,99,98,99,63,55,84,99]}

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:02.880
<v Speaker 2>We work that one out and I choose two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,99,99,99,99,75,99,99,99]}

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:05.969

<v Speaker 2>That's five shoes too.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,97,40,53]}

00:10:09.549 --> 00:10:11.729
<v Speaker 2>That was where no, it comes up a lot.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,98,96,90,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Well, you had five times 4 to 3.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,90,99,99,99,92,99]}

NOTE CONF {"raw":[4,84]}

00:10:21.599 --> 00:10:28.840
<v Speaker 2>And so it's five times 4/2 you get, and let's

00:11:25.049 --> 00:11:29.659
<v Speaker 3>you go back to this formula that I showed you

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.960

<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.030
<v Speaker 2>Or you can just bring it as a probability function,

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:25.440

<v Speaker 1>have equals here, you have to do a few cases.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:13:26.909 --> 00:13:27.280
<v Speaker 3>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:13:27.289 --> 00:13:32.969
<v Speaker 3>Now, the mean for binomial, I know you said this,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,95,80,39,83,99,99]}

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.190
<v Speaker 2>uh hang it up to here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,54,54,99,98,80]}

00:13:42.229 --> 00:13:44.250
<v Speaker 2>It said somewhere up here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

00:13:45.989 --> 00:13:48.309
<v Speaker 2>If not, I'll just, I'm just gonna point I don't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,99,38,95,79,99,70,96,59,26]}

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:48.630
<v Speaker 1>need it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,92]}

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:54.219
<v Speaker 1>So the need for Bonal has this nice simple formula

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,77,99,0,97,99,99,99,99]}

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.710
<v Speaker 3>U is equal to NP.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,97,99,99,98]}

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:02.530
<v Speaker 3>Um So, so if we want to mean it's N

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,99,97,99,99,99,99,99,93,99]}

00:14:02.539 --> 00:14:08.450
<v Speaker 1>times P and in this case N is five and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,96,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.010
<v Speaker 3>he is point two, so the me would be one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,99,99,99,99,99,81,98,99,97]}

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:14.820
<v Speaker 1>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:17.400
<v Speaker 1>It's just, you know, the idea is if, if this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,90,99]}

00:14:17.409 --> 00:14:19.969
<v Speaker 3>was an experiment and you repeated it over and over

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:14:19.979 --> 00:14:23.479
<v Speaker 2>and over again, your average X value would be one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:14:23.489 --> 00:14:29.320
<v Speaker 3>Now the standard deviation you will get the first, let's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,85,98,41,99,56]}

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:36.070
<v Speaker 1>say we very, the variance is N and P and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[42,48,40,99,95,99,99,90,99,51]}

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.849
<v Speaker 2>one mine is OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,61,55,99]}

00:14:40.859 --> 00:14:45.419
<v Speaker 2>So now we can put in, we get five, he

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,76,99,99,99,87,99,96]}

00:14:45.429 --> 00:14:50.809
<v Speaker 3>is 0.2 and one minus P would be point eight.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,95,94,78,99,99]}

00:14:53.359 --> 00:14:56.710
<v Speaker 2>And we know that five and 42 is the one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[65,85,99,99,99,98,98,99,69,99]}

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:03.260
<v Speaker 2>So this just gives us, but that's the variance.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,51,99,99,99,85]}

00:15:03.669 --> 00:15:08.570
<v Speaker 3>The standard deviation is the square root of that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,63,67,98]}

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.830
<v Speaker 1>And remember when you take the square root of a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,67,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.840
<v Speaker 1>number between zero and one, the number actually gets larger,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:15:21.099 --> 00:15:21.659
<v Speaker 1>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:28.450
<v Speaker 3>So this is about point nine 0.894.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,80,99,99,99]}

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:28.820
<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:15:29.309 --> 00:15:32.090
<v Speaker 2>So it's zero and 89.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,39,99,99,66]}

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:35.590
<v Speaker 2>So where's your skin?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,66,99,99]}

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:43.190
<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:49.729
<v Speaker 1>So that's, that, that's a basic uh binomial problem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,79,95,99,98,99,98,99,99]}

00:15:50.539 --> 00:15:53.729
<v Speaker 1>Most of the things that come up from there, what

00:15:53.739 --> 00:16:00.590
<v Speaker 2>I want to show you next, let's, this just sort

00:16:00.599 --> 00:16:08.469
<v Speaker 1>of justifies that you get um a probability distribution to

00:16:08.479 --> 00:16:09.820
<v Speaker 2>add up all these things.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,92,99,99,99]}

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.479
<v Speaker 2>But down here is what I want to look at,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:21.979
<v Speaker 1>um, when you have numbers where end is large, let's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,99,99,99,99,99,90,85,99,98]}

00:16:21.989 --> 00:16:24.630
<v Speaker 2>say greater than 10.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,98,99,99]}

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Ok.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh, 1520 50 100.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.010
<v Speaker 1>Um, it, it could be very large.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,93,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Ok.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.099
<v Speaker 3>We would use some sort of software to find it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:16:35.679 --> 00:16:38.409
<v Speaker 3>So I'll, I'll try to focus on our.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,82,79,99,99,57]}

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Ok, because that's what your book tries to do a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.530
<v Speaker 1>little bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.510
<v Speaker 3>So for a binomial distribution, if you wanted to calculate

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,98,98,99,99,99,87,99,99]}

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:54.169
<v Speaker 3>certain probabilities, you would start out your, your code with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:55.429
<v Speaker 3>AD OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:16:55.669 --> 00:16:59.940
<v Speaker 3>D is used when you want the exact probability.

00:17:01.369 --> 00:17:04.819
<v Speaker 3>So to use the language probability, if you wanted to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,54,99,89,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:09.229
<v Speaker 3>use sort of your PM F to use D, OK,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,95,99,66,99]}

00:17:09.808 --> 00:17:14.818
<v Speaker 3>if you wanted to find something like the probability that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:17:14.828 --> 00:17:16.879
<v Speaker 3>the X was, was less than three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,99,49,99,99,99,99]}

00:17:16.889 --> 00:17:17.379
<v Speaker 1>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:17:17.479 --> 00:17:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Here you would use the C DS, there would be

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:24.060
<v Speaker 1>a few in practical only you were only going sort

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,94,56,0,99,98,81,99,94,99]}

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:25.130

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:26.688
<v Speaker 1>OK?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:35.550
<v Speaker 3>So let's take a look at an example using R

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,97]}

00:17:35.569 --> 00:17:36.099
<v Speaker 1>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:17:36.469 --> 00:17:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Here's what we, we'll look at a couple.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,86,88,92,99,99,99,99]}

00:17:38.609 --> 00:17:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Um So, so this one here, um let's say X

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,78]}

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:53.709

00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:02.349
<v Speaker 2>So, so put that over here, the X say X,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,97,89,64,99,65,99]}

00:18:06.939 --> 00:18:11.489
<v Speaker 2>you find it on me, let's say 10 is 12

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,88,55,57,48,99,99,55,78,99]}

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:21.310
<v Speaker 2>and P you said here is 0.3 zero point if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,87,98,83,32,99,99,99,99]}

00:18:21.319 --> 00:18:28.829
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to fall probability that X is less than,

00:18:28.839 --> 00:18:35.040
<v Speaker 1>or equal to seven, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,85,99]}

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:40.219
<v Speaker 3>So if you were doing this, let's say, you know,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:18:40.229 --> 00:18:43.699
<v Speaker 3>pencil or paper pencil on a calculator.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,75,99,99]}

00:18:43.949 --> 00:18:46.329
<v Speaker 3>You would have to look at the cases where it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:18:46.339 --> 00:18:49.260
<v Speaker 3>012345, 67.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,66]}

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:50.839
<v Speaker 2>Ok.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:18:50.849 --> 00:18:52.020
<v Speaker 2>Work them out with the form.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,79,99]}

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:52.319
<v Speaker 2>Ok.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:18:52.329 --> 00:18:55.310
<v Speaker 2>So that, that's a little long p, it's doable but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,97,45,53,68,99]}

00:18:55.319 --> 00:19:00.660
<v Speaker 3>it's long and T, yeah, let's say we have a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,99,87,52,67,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:01.739
<v Speaker 3>technology.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Um, we'll do it with R but a lot of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:07.660
<v Speaker 3>the other technologies work the same way.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:11.810
<v Speaker 3>So it might have no sort of calculators do probabilities

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,82,99,99,89,99,99,99,83,99]}

00:19:11.819 --> 00:19:14.290
<v Speaker 3>with the distributions or, or Excel.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:14.920
<v Speaker 3>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:19:14.969 --> 00:19:15.979
<v Speaker 3>That works also.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,99,99]}

00:19:15.989 --> 00:19:18.699
<v Speaker 3>But I, I'll show you with R, let me clean

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,82,99,99,99,99,98,98,95,99]}

00:19:18.709 --> 00:19:21.239
<v Speaker 3>up this mess, take the broom out and sweep.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,59,99,99,99,99,99,85]}

00:19:21.939 --> 00:19:22.719
<v Speaker 3>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.680
<v Speaker 3>So what I would do here is, first of all,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:19:27.689 --> 00:19:31.209
<v Speaker 3>you have to think is this exact or is it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:19:31.219 --> 00:19:37.290
<v Speaker 3>cumulative, exact is when you have an equal sign, cumulative

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:39.109
<v Speaker 1>is when you have a less than an equal two?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,85,99,99,93,99,73]}

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:39.449
<v Speaker 1>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:19:39.459 --> 00:19:41.209
<v Speaker 1>So it's cumulative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:47.079
<v Speaker 3>Remember this thing I just told you, yeah, you have

00:19:47.089 --> 00:19:50.270
<v Speaker 3>to start out with P when it's cumulative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,91,0]}

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:51.319
<v Speaker 1>OK?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:55.170
<v Speaker 1>And this is true for all, all the discrete probabilities,

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:55.640
<v Speaker 3>OK?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:19:55.739 --> 00:20:00.229
<v Speaker 3>This little um D versus P works, you know, in

00:20:00.239 --> 00:20:00.920
<v Speaker 3>R.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:08.479
<v Speaker 3>So I would put P I know now we are,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,0,37,86,45,48]}

00:20:08.489 --> 00:20:13.339
<v Speaker 1>it's just PB and sort of prompts you a little

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,95,61,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:13.349 --> 00:20:13.770
<v Speaker 1>bit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:20:14.119 --> 00:20:19.599
<v Speaker 2>Um So, so typically, you know, well, art puts it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,98,98,99,67]}

00:20:19.609 --> 00:20:20.579
<v Speaker 1>in a Q there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,99,92,95]}

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:26.829
<v Speaker 3>Um This first value is, is what most software we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,98,99,99,57,99,99,99,99,90]}

00:20:26.839 --> 00:20:28.400
<v Speaker 3>call you on the X value.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,81,93,99,99,90]}

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:30.089
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you put in here would be the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,99,99,82,99,97,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:30.099 --> 00:20:30.609
<v Speaker 1>set.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85]}

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:37.390
<v Speaker 2>So I put in seven the size, well, that, that's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[46,94,76,97,99,99,99,93,87,99]}

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.780
<v Speaker 3>n that would be 12.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:46.069
<v Speaker 1>Um, and then the probability, that's the probability of success

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:46.189 --> 00:20:49.270
<v Speaker 2>that would be 0.3.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

00:20:52.219 --> 00:20:55.250
<v Speaker 2>And that's all we really need.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,99,98,99,99,99]}

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.579
<v Speaker 2>We don't need those other items.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:02.119
<v Speaker 2>Um, so let's see, let's not put my count here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82,99,99,99,99,99,99,80,94,99]}

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:03.280
<v Speaker 2>and then we hit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:21:05.689 --> 00:21:09.949
<v Speaker 1>And you get more probability 0.9905.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,54,99,99]}

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:15.020
<v Speaker 1>So, so what did we do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,88,99,99]}

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.839
<v Speaker 2>Let's see, we'll write the number here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,58,97,99,99,99]}

00:21:16.849 --> 00:21:21.199
<v Speaker 2>We have 0.9905.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:21:23.359 --> 00:21:31.650
<v Speaker 2>We use the I 712.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[86,99,91,81,99]}

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:40.410
<v Speaker 2>You uh point ok.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,57,82,99]}

00:21:40.489 --> 00:21:42.400
<v Speaker 2>Questions about that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,90]}

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:48.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, let's say we wanted an exact probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,77,99,99]}

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:49.160
<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:21:49.319 --> 00:21:52.369
<v Speaker 2>So you could see that here in, in part two,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:21:53.589 --> 00:22:03.150
<v Speaker 1>we want probability uh X is equals.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,95,92,96,99,98]}

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:08.369
<v Speaker 3>So that would just be the, you know, the case

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.969
<v Speaker 1>where uh you wanna find, you know, be at seven.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,98,99,99,98,55,51,99]}

00:22:13.599 --> 00:22:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Now, that would be a fair test question, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,98]}

00:22:15.969 --> 00:22:17.739
<v Speaker 3>You know, less than, or equal to on, on a

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:18.119
<v Speaker 3>test.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:19.599
<v Speaker 3>Like I said, you have to do, you know the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,98]}

00:22:19.609 --> 00:22:22.770
<v Speaker 3>eight cases which it's not that it's that hard, it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,88,99,99,97,99,99,95]}

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.000
<v Speaker 3>just, you know, long and t, so here we have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,72,89,99,99,31,88,99,99,73]}

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:26.930
<v Speaker 1>three cases that's sort of long enough.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:22:27.089 --> 00:22:27.459
<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:22:27.469 --> 00:22:32.869
<v Speaker 2>But um, but if you need to know this and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.930
<v Speaker 3>you wanted to use R, now we would start with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,97,92,97,99]}

00:22:36.939 --> 00:22:45.010
<v Speaker 3>D so D vinyl and then these inputs are exactly

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,99,99,95,99,65,99,98,98,95]}

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:55.430
<v Speaker 1>the same seven 12 and 0.3 and then we get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[24,85,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:22:55.439 --> 00:22:55.719
<v Speaker 2>it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:22:56.489 --> 00:23:01.680
<v Speaker 2>Uh You see, we got 0.029 uh one, let's say,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,96,99,99,91,97,99,85,88,99]}

00:23:06.189 --> 00:23:17.319
<v Speaker 2>OK, so here you d why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,46,54,53]}

00:23:18.599 --> 00:23:18.689
<v Speaker 2>So?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[38]}

00:23:20.109 --> 00:23:30.760
<v Speaker 2>Well, ok, now let's take a look at another minor

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:31.689
<v Speaker 2>wrinkle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:40.829
<v Speaker 2>Um let's say we wanted something like this number greater

NOTE CONF {"raw":[78,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:23:40.839 --> 00:23:43.989
<v Speaker 2>than people a pro, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,58,99,99]}

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:52.089
<v Speaker 2>So, ok, greater than are equal to self.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,54,99,97,99,99,99,77]}

00:23:55.339 --> 00:23:55.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50]}

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.540
<v Speaker 1>So, so what you need to at least think of,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:00.599
<v Speaker 3>I'll write it out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[39,99,99,99]}

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:05.550
<v Speaker 1>But this, this would be the sum of the probability

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,98]}

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.959
<v Speaker 1>of seven, 89, 1011 and 12.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[45,99,49,99,99,99]}

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:15.050
<v Speaker 3>Me, it can't be more than 12, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[51,98,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:18.349
<v Speaker 3>If you're looking for the, you know, the probability of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,97,99,99,82,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:24:18.359 --> 00:24:21.550
<v Speaker 3>seven or more successes in 12 tries.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,79,99,42]}

00:24:23.469 --> 00:24:24.010
<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.489
<v Speaker 2>So seven or more.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:27.219
<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:24:27.229 --> 00:24:30.280
<v Speaker 2>So you wanna include the K seven and you wanna

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,96,99,99,77,99,99,99,93]}

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:33.760
<v Speaker 2>go 7897, that's if you were sort of doing it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,49,74,99,99,56,99,98,99,99]}

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:36.270
<v Speaker 1>out by hand, you would, you know, include all those

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,90,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:42.510
<v Speaker 1>cases if we have a technology to use like our

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,97]}

00:24:42.589 --> 00:24:45.660
<v Speaker 1>and all, like I said, all of these, you know,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,97,99,96,96,99,88,99,99,99]}

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.479
<v Speaker 3>calculators and software enrollments actually are all the same.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,98,99,77,78,71,99,99,99]}

00:24:49.969 --> 00:24:53.689
<v Speaker 3>Um You have to use the top of it here

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,55,41,97]}

00:24:54.319 --> 00:24:55.900
<v Speaker 3>and use the CD F.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,89]}

00:24:56.079 --> 00:25:02.910
<v Speaker 3>So, so this would be one minus and have to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,96,99,97,99]}

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:08.410
<v Speaker 3>be careful X less than equal to six.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.770
<v Speaker 3>Well, it would be strictly less than seven or less

NOTE CONF {"raw":[60,99,64,99,99,99,99,99,95,75]}

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:11.530
<v Speaker 2>than equal to six.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,99,42,99]}

00:25:12.849 --> 00:25:18.660
<v Speaker 2>The discreetness plays an important role, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,97,99,99,99,93,99]}

00:25:18.989 --> 00:25:21.099
<v Speaker 2>So, um, all right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,98,98,98]}

00:25:21.109 --> 00:25:26.959
<v Speaker 3>So now, right, so if we were doing this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,85,47,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.469
<v Speaker 3>Well, you all right, let me show it to you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,54,67,87,75,77,97,98,99,99]}

00:25:29.479 --> 00:25:30.979
<v Speaker 1>first and I'll write it out there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,55,77,99,99,98,99]}

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:39.969
<v Speaker 3>You would have to do one minus.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:25:41.479 --> 00:25:44.020
<v Speaker 3>Now, do I need an E or A P?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,78,96,99,95,99]}

00:25:48.069 --> 00:25:48.209
<v Speaker 3>You?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[84]}

00:25:48.319 --> 00:25:48.459
<v Speaker 3>Pee?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49]}

00:25:48.469 --> 00:25:52.589
<v Speaker 3>Yeah, because I want the Q uh so one LP

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,99,99,92,97,94,78,99,99,0]}

00:25:53.489 --> 00:26:03.969
<v Speaker 1>and then it's final and we said six 12 and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,89,34,95,99,99,99,99,99,96]}

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:17.270
<v Speaker 2>we still point so we get 0.0386 zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[44,38,67,99,99,99,97,99]}

00:26:21.609 --> 00:26:30.020
<v Speaker 2>So, so here the code would be one minus mm

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,92,40]}

00:26:33.339 --> 00:26:38.969
<v Speaker 2>final six 01.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,45]}

00:26:40.339 --> 00:26:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Now, if you're doing homework and I ask you to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,93,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:47.310
<v Speaker 3>use R to do a probability um and I say,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,96,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:26:47.319 --> 00:26:49.689
<v Speaker 1>you know, copy and paste the code, I mean, this,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70,66,99,99,99,99,99,93,54,99]}

00:26:49.699 --> 00:26:51.349
<v Speaker 1>this is sort of what I want to do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,64,41]}

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:55.000
<v Speaker 1>So, so you could just, you know, in R you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:26:55.010 --> 00:27:00.209
<v Speaker 1>could just go here and copy or, you know, highlight

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,73,99,97,99]}

00:27:00.219 --> 00:27:04.729
<v Speaker 1>those two things, the mouse, you could hit copy and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:27:04.739 --> 00:27:09.770
<v Speaker 2>then you could, you know, paste it um in your,

00:27:09.969 --> 00:27:14.969
<v Speaker 2>your word document, I just put it in a like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,98,98,86,55,70,64,36]}

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:17.829
<v Speaker 2>slide here and I hit pace.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,99,99,99,99,63]}

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.760
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you gotta, you can sort of see it here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,75,99,93,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:27.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why it, when you paste it, it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,90,99,99,98,99,99]}

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:31.109
<v Speaker 1>comes across being so small but you just have to,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,95,99]}

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:35.209
<v Speaker 2>he said that it on me.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[76,97,63,62,49,88]}

00:27:37.709 --> 00:27:38.369
<v Speaker 2>OK?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.729
<v Speaker 1>Um And then, you know, if you had something like

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,62,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:27:42.739 --> 00:27:45.439
<v Speaker 1>this, it's one other case I have, it's, it's a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,33,99,98,99,99,99,55,91,99]}

00:27:45.449 --> 00:27:52.849
<v Speaker 1>good one to look at, find the probability with X

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,51,99]}

00:27:54.239 --> 00:28:01.089
<v Speaker 3>is between four and seven, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,48]}

00:28:01.979 --> 00:28:05.619
<v Speaker 1>So that one you want to first think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,97]}

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:08.420
<v Speaker 3>All right, I think the case is 45 67.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,90,99,99,99,99,50]}

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Not that you had to do it out but, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,54,58,78,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:15.880
<v Speaker 3>if we're doing this with, with art, what you wanna

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,81,99,99,98]}

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:21.810
<v Speaker 3>do is take everything up to seven.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:28:22.079 --> 00:28:32.439
<v Speaker 3>So that would be something like this BB 712, 0.3

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,56,99,99]}

00:28:33.209 --> 00:28:37.810
<v Speaker 2>and then get rid of the cases from 0 to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:28:37.819 --> 00:28:39.530
<v Speaker 2>3, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,98]}

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:41.810
<v Speaker 2>Because you want to be left with 4567.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[94,95,54,57,99,99,99,49]}

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:50.010
<v Speaker 2>So minus, hey, well, I know six.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,91,50,61,99,97,99]}

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.300
<v Speaker 2>No, not six.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,99,99]}

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:51.989
<v Speaker 2>Great.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74]}

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:08.459
<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.709
<v Speaker 2>And you can see if we can work that out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,92,99,99,99,0,99,99,99]}

00:29:11.719 --> 00:29:14.209
<v Speaker 1>We should get the number up here there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,89]}

00:29:14.469 --> 00:29:17.229
<v Speaker 2>Um Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,83]}

00:29:23.829 --> 00:29:24.329
<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:29:28.359 --> 00:29:30.550
<v Speaker 2>And we get it all makes sense good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,99,79,63,99,74,99,99]}

00:29:31.959 --> 00:29:34.959
<v Speaker 2>Um OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99]}

00:29:34.969 --> 00:29:36.199
<v Speaker 2>So let's see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.199
<v Speaker 1>Well, we'll do another one in our uh in a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,83,99,99,99,99,99,90,99,99]}

00:29:42.219 --> 00:29:43.089
<v Speaker 1>little while.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:29:43.099 --> 00:29:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Uh let's say here we have just the, the definition

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:29:49.819 --> 00:29:50.089
<v Speaker 3>here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:29:50.099 --> 00:29:51.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean, I've showed you once but here it is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,94,95,99,98,98,99,99,99,99]}

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:54.930
<v Speaker 3>again, uh you know, the mean and variance for a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,56,39,97,59]}

00:29:54.939 --> 00:29:56.880
<v Speaker 1>binomial distribution.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99]}

00:29:57.349 --> 00:30:00.109
<v Speaker 3>So, so the mean, we call it sometimes the X,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,90,99,56,95]}

00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:05.520
<v Speaker 3>sometimes U is N times P and the variance is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,74,99,99,99,99,99,89,99]}

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:07.859
<v Speaker 3>anti P one minus P.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[46,98,99,99,96]}

00:30:08.329 --> 00:30:10.819
<v Speaker 2>So let's say we have something like this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:30:10.829 --> 00:30:13.699
<v Speaker 2>It says a, a coin is weighted so that the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,98,80,99,88,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:30:13.709 --> 00:30:19.739
<v Speaker 1>probability of heads is 0.55 hes to 0.45.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,29,54,99]}

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:24.310
<v Speaker 1>The experiment consists of look at the corn two 100

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,98,99,99,73,93,99,67,99,99]}

00:30:24.319 --> 00:30:30.400
<v Speaker 3>times when X be the number of heads that occurs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,84]}

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:34.349
<v Speaker 1>What's the average number of heads for that experiment?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:38.359
<v Speaker 1>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:30:38.369 --> 00:30:41.540
<v Speaker 1>So firstly, you should realize, I mean, you know, it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:44.420
<v Speaker 3>here because it's in the context, but that would be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,54,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:46.300
<v Speaker 3>a binomial experiment, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,96,99,99]}

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:49.319
<v Speaker 3>Because you flipping a coin and you have two outcomes,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,99,65,99,99,98,99,99,99,99]}

00:30:49.329 --> 00:30:50.780
<v Speaker 2>head heads and tails.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,96,99,97]}

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:53.739
<v Speaker 2>Um And then you have the dependence.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,78,51]}

00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:04.550
<v Speaker 3>So the average number of heads would be what again,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,95]}

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.160
<v Speaker 3>imagine you're repeating this experiment, you know, over and over

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,53,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:07.449
<v Speaker 3>again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:31:07.479 --> 00:31:10.189
<v Speaker 3>Yeah, 100 and 10 left.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,99,99,99,80]}

00:31:10.859 --> 00:31:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Anybody see that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,99,99]}

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:12.380
<v Speaker 2>How did you get it?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,59,99,95,99]}

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.439
<v Speaker 1>Um I did 0.55 times 200.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:31:15.619 --> 00:31:16.449
<v Speaker 2>Yeah, that's right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,71,70]}

00:31:16.459 --> 00:31:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah, you did N times BN is 200 is point

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,97,89,99,99,99]}

00:31:19.819 --> 00:31:20.599
<v Speaker 1>55.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66]}

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.849
<v Speaker 2>So a 110 and that should make sense.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:31:23.859 --> 00:31:28.359
<v Speaker 3>This is, this is one of those formulas that it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,71]}

00:31:28.369 --> 00:31:30.739
<v Speaker 1>easy to just, you know, figure out with, with or

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,96,99,99]}

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:31.920
<v Speaker 2>without the formula.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:31:32.119 --> 00:31:35.339
<v Speaker 2>Um What's the variant?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,0]}

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:38.750
<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:44.719
<v Speaker 1>So, so the variance for this um everybody should be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,54,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:31:44.729 --> 00:32:01.400
<v Speaker 1>able to figure that out of the variance is N

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,91,98,99,99,99]}

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:04.780
<v Speaker 2>times P times one minus P, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:32:04.939 --> 00:32:13.489
<v Speaker 1>So you take them the various and it was 200

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,75,82,54,74,98,99,95,90,99]}

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:22.859
<v Speaker 1>P is 0.551 MP would be 0.45.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,86,51,99,99,99]}

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:26.689
<v Speaker 1>We don't when we multiply those two, I get 100

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:32:26.699 --> 00:32:27.349
<v Speaker 1>and 10.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,99]}

00:32:28.459 --> 00:32:31.729
<v Speaker 2>Is this 100 and 10 5.45.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,86,99,99,99,86]}

00:32:31.739 --> 00:32:32.819
<v Speaker 2>What do we get from that back?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,95,99,99,99,99,65]}

00:32:34.199 --> 00:32:34.890
<v Speaker 2>Where you at?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[49,63,32]}

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.660
<v Speaker 2>So switch to all those formulas and again, this is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,95,69,90,99,92,73,99,99,99]}

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:49.229
<v Speaker 3>the form distribution for, you know, a few reasons that

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,96,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,66]}

00:32:49.239 --> 00:32:52.680
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of discrete situations that get modeled with

00:32:52.689 --> 00:32:53.599
<v Speaker 2>the binomial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,96]}

00:32:53.869 --> 00:32:58.339
<v Speaker 2>But also just from, you know, the course perspective, this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:32:58.349 --> 00:33:03.680
<v Speaker 1>comes up again in like chapters six, chapter seven, chapter

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:33:03.689 --> 00:33:06.280
<v Speaker 3>eight, it comes up over and over and over again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,84,99,99,99,99]}

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:06.770
<v Speaker 3>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:11.400
<v Speaker 3>So, and, and these formulas come up uh especially so,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:13.050

00:33:15.949 --> 00:33:18.550
<v Speaker 1>All right, let's see here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:26.310
<v Speaker 2>No, wanna do that one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[80,71,81,99,99]}

00:33:26.699 --> 00:33:29.280
<v Speaker 2>I will skip that one because I have a bunch

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,75,63,99,95,99,99]}

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:30.459

00:33:30.469 --> 00:33:34.660
<v Speaker 2>But um histograms for the binomial, if you were to

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:39.880
<v Speaker 3>make some sort of histogram or bar charts, then you

<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:33:51.709 --> 00:33:55.869
<v Speaker 1>And you made a chart of the probabilities that you

<v Speaker 2>OK?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:33:58.569 --> 00:34:00.660

<v Speaker 2>Um and mine is what P is zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[54,80,86,89,91,99,89,99]}

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:48.469
<v Speaker 2>Um Thanks when he was, we did that 13763 and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[0,99,47,19,67,99,99,99,82,99]}

00:43:48.479 --> 00:43:49.270
<v Speaker 2>D of two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[48,84,99]}

00:43:50.879 --> 00:43:51.110
<v Speaker 0>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[70]}

00:43:52.189 --> 00:43:55.530
<v Speaker 2>1681 grapes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[79,0]}

00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:57.870
<v Speaker 2>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:43:58.219 --> 00:44:10.969
<v Speaker 2>And then add them all up and good, good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,91,97,99,97,99,79,55,99]}

00:44:10.979 --> 00:44:11.610
<v Speaker 2>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Um One more this one that will do with R.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,97,99,99,98,93,90,83,71]}

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:25.739
<v Speaker 3>So let's say this is the final move now and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,85,99,70,54,49,97,64,38,97]}

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:28.260
<v Speaker 1>it's 58.47.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,95]}

00:44:29.979 --> 00:44:33.909
<v Speaker 2>Find the following using on.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,99,99,99,58]}

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:35.070
<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:42.860
<v Speaker 2>So we want the first one we want is probability

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,94,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:46.689
<v Speaker 1>X is equal to 35.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:50.820
<v Speaker 3>So that would be an exact probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.629
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna clean that up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,87,99,99,99]}

00:44:53.820 --> 00:45:02.199
<v Speaker 2>So this would be E by home X is 35

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,62,93,99,99,99]}

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:09.090
<v Speaker 2>and it's 50 and E was 0.47.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[93,40,99,99,60,99,99]}

00:45:14.649 --> 00:45:19.389
<v Speaker 2>So you can see we got 0.0005 and a bunch

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,53,99,99,92,99,99,99,99]}

00:45:19.399 --> 00:45:21.719
<v Speaker 2>of decimals I think.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,36,99,99]}

00:45:21.729 --> 00:45:24.939
<v Speaker 2>I do have this on the next slide.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:45:26.379 --> 00:45:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh Yeah, just like thank you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,81,49,87,99,99]}

00:45:32.199 --> 00:45:39.219
<v Speaker 1>Now, what if we want the probability X less than

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,89,99,99]}

00:45:39.229 --> 00:45:39.919
<v Speaker 2>35?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:42.000
<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.169
<v Speaker 2>So you can see here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,54,99,99]}

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:45.139
<v Speaker 2>So here you want things cumulative.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,63,54,25]}

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:46.280
<v Speaker 1>OK?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:52.840
<v Speaker 3>But your X value she should be 34 right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,99,99,99,95,43,95,84,99]}

00:45:53.239 --> 00:45:55.520
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't wanna include 35.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,94,99,99]}

00:45:55.879 --> 00:46:00.290
<v Speaker 1>So you go up to 34 you know, I have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,72,72,99,97]}

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:01.110
<v Speaker 2>it right over here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,99,99,99]}

00:46:03.909 --> 00:46:05.449
<v Speaker 3>And so if you put it in, you can see

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,78,99]}

00:46:05.459 --> 00:46:08.889
<v Speaker 1>you get point 999151, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98,99,85,52]}

00:46:10.639 --> 00:46:17.760
<v Speaker 1>And then if we wanted the probability that is greater

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,97,99,99]}

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:20.830
<v Speaker 2>than, or equal to 37 OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,82,99,94,99,99]}

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:24.629
<v Speaker 2>So, or a state you have to use the compliment.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,79,85,50,99,99,99,99,99,67]}

00:46:25.919 --> 00:46:29.570
<v Speaker 2>So that would be one less the probability X is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,57,99,99,99,98]}

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:32.379
<v Speaker 2>less than equal to 30 six.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:37.659
<v Speaker 2>All right, that's where students make a mistake is, is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,79,99]}

00:46:37.669 --> 00:46:41.590
<v Speaker 2>that, you know, you should use the 36 here uh

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,97,99,99,98]}

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:46.399
<v Speaker 3>just like this and it is cumulative and you get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:46:46.409 --> 00:46:47.419
<v Speaker 2>this very small one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,89]}

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:53.419
<v Speaker 3>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:46:53.429 --> 00:46:56.209
<v Speaker 3>So there, there's a lot of good applications for your

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,95,99,99,99,99,99,90,62,98]}

00:46:56.229 --> 00:46:59.030
<v Speaker 1>B I mean, it's, but it all comes down to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[50,99,99,74,96,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.320
<v Speaker 2>doing these basic calculations.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Uh All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:11.199
<v Speaker 2>So let's go on and what's distribution we're gonna look

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,98,56,99,85,93,99]}

00:47:11.209 --> 00:47:15.060
<v Speaker 1>at is called the hypergeometric.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,98,99,91,99]}

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:19.399
<v Speaker 1>And here's just an example, I'll give you the, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,62,85]}

00:47:19.409 --> 00:47:22.419
<v Speaker 3>formal description in a minute, but it's always nice to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,35,99,99,99]}

00:47:22.429 --> 00:47:24.040
<v Speaker 3>do an example first.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

00:47:24.489 --> 00:47:32.739
<v Speaker 2>Um Let's say we have a lot by that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,96]}

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:38.439
<v Speaker 2>I mean, you know, like a batch, a batch of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:47:38.469 --> 00:47:39.989
<v Speaker 1>100 light bulbs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:46.290
<v Speaker 1>And you know that one of your defectives find the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,97,98,91,63,99,99]}

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:54.469
<v Speaker 3>probability that among a randomly selected sample of 10 you

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,97]}

00:47:54.479 --> 00:47:55.399
<v Speaker 2>are effective.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,54]}

00:47:56.429 --> 00:48:00.050
<v Speaker 3>And here, now I'm gonna say, using basic understanding of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,88,67,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:00.699
<v Speaker 1>probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[18]}

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.370
<v Speaker 3>So this is the sort of thing that happens with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:48:06.379 --> 00:48:08.340
<v Speaker 1>quality inspections.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,91]}

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:13.540
<v Speaker 2>Why quality inspections are, aren't important.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,99,99,99,47,99]}

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:15.629
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you watch the news, but Boeing

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,95,86,98,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:48:15.639 --> 00:48:17.729
<v Speaker 3>is getting in big trouble these days because they don't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[92,99,99,99,99,99,99,71,99,99]}

00:48:17.739 --> 00:48:19.429
<v Speaker 1>have good quality control.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,83,99,99]}

00:48:19.649 --> 00:48:21.989
<v Speaker 1>And then I just, you know, a part fell off

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,98,99,99,86,99,95,99]}

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.530
<v Speaker 3>of one of the planes because it wasn't bolted down

NOTE CONF {"raw":[73,99,99,63,99,98,99,99,99,99]}

00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:27.060
<v Speaker 2>properly and they're blaming everything on it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,96,85,99,99,99,89]}

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:33.010
<v Speaker 1>The quality control people at Boeing anyway.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,75,53,99]}

00:48:33.179 --> 00:48:36.649
<v Speaker 3>So here what we can do now, now what makes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,63,99,88,86,99,99]}

00:48:36.659 --> 00:48:41.770
<v Speaker 3>us a little different and, you know, I don't come

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,99,99,99,97,98,99,99,99]}

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:44.820
<v Speaker 1>out and say to you, but you don't have replacements.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,90,93,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:48:45.239 --> 00:48:45.850
<v Speaker 2>Ok.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:48:46.399 --> 00:48:50.879
<v Speaker 1>So, so what you have to think of is that,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:58.699
<v Speaker 3>um, there's 20 defects and we want to know sort

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,51,72,99,99]}

00:48:58.709 --> 00:49:01.080
<v Speaker 1>of the probability of, of getting two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,54,99,99,99]}

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:04.000
<v Speaker 3>So, so the number of ways to get two feedbacks

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,39]}

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:08.760
<v Speaker 3>is 22 2, but we'll take a sample of size

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,93,99,71,39,66,96,99,99,99]}

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:09.179
<v Speaker 3>10.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:49:09.189 --> 00:49:12.320
<v Speaker 3>So that means I need eight non deff effects.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,0,0]}

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:16.679
<v Speaker 3>So the number of ways to get eight non defects

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,0]}

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:21.330
<v Speaker 3>is 80 to 8 and the number of ways to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,88,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:25.290
<v Speaker 1>pick a sample size 10 is 100 cheese 10.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,97,99]}

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:26.729
<v Speaker 0>Ok.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:29.669
<v Speaker 0>So we could, you know, work all of these out.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:34.439
<v Speaker 3>Um, and we get 0.318.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,88]}

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:37.879
<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:49:37.929 --> 00:49:42.560
<v Speaker 2>So, so that's the probability that when you take some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:45.320
<v Speaker 3>sample, think of this as some random sample out of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,98,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:46.129
<v Speaker 3>the box, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:48.580
<v Speaker 3>Imagine you're starting out and you have a box of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,97,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:52.280
<v Speaker 3>100 let's say, and you're gonna take a random sample

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,94,86,99,99,99,99]}

00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:56.389
<v Speaker 3>of 10, this is the probability that two out of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:49:56.399 --> 00:49:57.639
<v Speaker 1>those 10 are defective.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,19]}

00:49:59.199 --> 00:49:59.659
<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:04.929
<v Speaker 2>Um So now you could use this using a probability

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,98,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:50:04.939 --> 00:50:05.320
<v Speaker 3>function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:07.000
<v Speaker 3>I'll show you the probability function.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:12.500
<v Speaker 1>So uh so let's take a look at what happens

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:17.270
<v Speaker 2>here in the general said uh is called the hypergeometric

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,45,27,99,95,99,96,99,95,99]}

00:50:26.409 --> 00:50:29.570
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is if you have a finite population

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:50:30.139 --> 00:50:37.770
<v Speaker 1>with an individuals and your sampling with no replacement, the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,75,99,95,96,93,99,99,99,99]}

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:41.300
<v Speaker 3>items can be classified as success or failure.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.669
<v Speaker 3>And there's capital a successes in the population, you've taken

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,65,99,96,99,99,99,99,68,72]}

00:50:48.679 --> 00:50:53.830
<v Speaker 2>a sample of size N, you know, that's the lower

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:56.649
<v Speaker 3>case N, right, lower case N is always sample size.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,99,99,99,85,99,99,94,99,99]}

00:50:56.659 --> 00:50:59.939
<v Speaker 3>Capital N is the population size.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:51:00.479 --> 00:51:07.969
<v Speaker 1>Then the probability that you have, let's say X, successes

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,97,99]}

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:12.790
<v Speaker 2>in A two X on N MS A two nm

<v Speaker 1>X over capital N choose lower case A.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,64,47]}

00:51:22.199 --> 00:51:26.260
<v Speaker 3>So you could say that's, that's what we call the,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,69,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:27.659
<v Speaker 3>the Pff.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,98]}

<v Speaker 1>Um And I don't know if you really needed, I

00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:38.689
<v Speaker 2>mean, I think if it's hypergeometric, I find, you know,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:51:38.699 --> 00:51:41.370

00:51:48.389 --> 00:51:52.100
<v Speaker 1>to pick, you're picking subsets, you have a certain number

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,74]}

00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:56.830
<v Speaker 1>Um And then you have, you know, non defectives.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,43]}

00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:00.399
<v Speaker 2>That's typically what these problems uh look like.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:07.310

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:11.149
<v Speaker 2>comes up, I guess I have it on another slide.

00:52:11.439 --> 00:52:18.649
<v Speaker 2>It's good to know these formulas as well, especially the,

<v Speaker 2>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:52:41.419 --> 00:52:43.300
<v Speaker 2>So now let's just go back and take a look

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,97,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:44.429

00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:08.300

00:53:11.399 --> 00:53:15.379
<v Speaker 3>So if we put it in the context of this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:53:15.389 --> 00:53:20.350

<v Speaker 2>OK?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[0]}

00:53:41.969 --> 00:53:45.870
<v Speaker 2>It is five and the population is size 25.

00:53:46.959 --> 00:53:52.669
<v Speaker 2>So you get five, choose two, 22 10, divided by

<v Speaker 1>Probability.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:17.399

<v Speaker 2>Ok.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:01:18.239 --> 01:01:20.510
<v Speaker 2>So it's an at most question.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,93,88,72]}

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:24.229
<v Speaker 2>So we wanna break that down into the case case

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,74,80,99,99]}

01:01:24.239 --> 01:01:27.399
<v Speaker 1>where you have zero defects, one defect and two defects.

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:33.949
<v Speaker 2>Uh, so the case with, with zero defects, we, we

01:01:33.959 --> 01:01:37.290

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:40.469
<v Speaker 1>be 52, zero.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,49,99]}

01:01:41.169 --> 01:01:48.070
<v Speaker 3>And then if there's five defects, that means there's 15,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,97,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:49.879

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

01:01:50.159 --> 01:01:57.590
<v Speaker 1>So, then this would be 15 to 10 divided by

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61,97]}

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:20.179
<v Speaker 2>to 9 over the same denominator 2210.

01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:24.439
<v Speaker 2>And then five tubes too.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,29,98]}

01:02:26.439 --> 01:02:27.389
<v Speaker 2>I was 15.

<v Speaker 2>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

01:02:38.429 --> 01:02:47.969
<v Speaker 2>So now, um, I don't know, does anybody have these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,98,61,95,99,99,99,99]}

01:02:47.979 --> 01:02:49.290

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Is it one by one this see a few different

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,89,99,99,99,62,99,99,99,99]}

01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:54.120
<v Speaker 2>ways we can go back to this.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,65,99,61,97,95]}

01:03:05.649 --> 01:03:10.439
<v Speaker 2>What I would do here is at first it depends.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,91,99,52,22]}

01:03:10.459 --> 01:03:10.669
<v Speaker 2>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[46,51]}

01:03:10.679 --> 01:03:12.709
<v Speaker 2>Well, I think we have a common denominator.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.020
<v Speaker 2>The denominator is 2210.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88,99,99,83]}

01:03:16.850 --> 01:03:20.570
<v Speaker 2>Um, so you could work that out if you want

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,99,99,99,99,99,98,99,99]}

01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:22.639
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what number that is.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:03:23.219 --> 01:03:26.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh, a lot of calculators would go through that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,98,84,99,99]}

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:29.909
<v Speaker 2>So let's see if we just think in terms of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,90,96,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:03:31.290 --> 01:03:35.100
<v Speaker 2>calculate, let's see if this is gonna work for you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,98,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,93]}

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:47.580
<v Speaker 2>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:50.360
<v Speaker 2>Excel does a lot of these calculations.

01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:53.540
<v Speaker 2>So if you wanted, let's say 2210.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,98]}

01:03:55.330 --> 01:03:59.909
<v Speaker 2>Well, like cell calls, this comin sort of a combinatorial.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[56,36,13,99,99,55,99,99,97,99]}

01:04:03.010 --> 01:04:04.979

NOTE CONF {"raw":[68,64,76]}

01:04:07.709 --> 01:04:08.929
<v Speaker 2>So let's say if you wanted that.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,99,74,97,99,98,92]}

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:10.689

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:55.120
<v Speaker 2>I, that would be the first one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[63,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:04:56.899 --> 01:05:00.179
<v Speaker 3>Now the second one, if I choose one it's gonna

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,99,99,86,97,99,99,92,99]}

01:05:00.189 --> 01:05:01.080
<v Speaker 1>be five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

01:05:01.899 --> 01:05:05.189
<v Speaker 2>So let's get your ass 15 to 9.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,3,83,98,99,26,99]}

01:05:12.389 --> 01:05:13.739

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:15.659
<v Speaker 2>Nine, 5000 five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

01:05:15.669 --> 01:05:19.429
<v Speaker 3>But I have to multiply that by five, the people's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,75,46]}

01:05:19.439 --> 01:05:27.820
<v Speaker 2>five times this, so that becomes 25 05.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[71,99,99,99,99,99,99,65]}

01:05:34.699 --> 01:05:40.689
<v Speaker 2>And then this last one when I said five choose

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,54,67,89,99,99]}

01:05:40.699 --> 01:05:43.280
<v Speaker 1>two for whatever reason it comes up a lot, it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:05:43.290 --> 01:05:45.629
<v Speaker 2>worth remembering that that's equal to 10.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,98,99,99,99,99]}

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:46.429
<v Speaker 2>Ok.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:05:46.439 --> 01:05:49.070
<v Speaker 2>So we did a five choose 4/2.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,60,80,99,99,99]}

01:05:49.399 --> 01:05:52.229
<v Speaker 2>Um So let me figure out 15 choose eight.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,96,97,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:06:00.949 --> 01:06:05.469
<v Speaker 2>So that's 6430 five and then multiplying by 10 just

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,65,82,97,99,99,99]}

01:06:05.479 --> 01:06:09.330
<v Speaker 1>puts a zero line to 6435.

01:06:14.949 --> 01:06:18.870
<v Speaker 1>So if you add them all up divided by 1

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,89,99,99]}

01:06:18.879 --> 01:06:21.250

<v Speaker 3>Ok.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:06:55.659 --> 01:06:57.469
<v Speaker 3>So let's, let's go ahead and add it up and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:06:57.479 --> 01:06:58.129

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,74,99,77,98]}

01:06:59.189 --> 01:07:07.139
<v Speaker 2>Um So I'm going to add some 3003 for us.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,98,99,83,77]}

01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:13.699

<v Speaker 2>64 350.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,74]}

01:07:19.409 --> 01:07:29.739
<v Speaker 2>Close the parenthesis divide by 1 84 756 0.5 CC.

01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:32.729
<v Speaker 2>Say to get exactly 0.5.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,53,74,99,99]}

01:07:32.739 --> 01:07:43.070
<v Speaker 2>But ok, so it looks like we need to correct

01:07:44.219 --> 01:07:44.689

<v Speaker 0>Acid.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[82]}

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,59,99,99,99]}

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:09.699

01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:31.080
<v Speaker 2>Um So I would say next to the binomial, this

01:08:31.088 --> 01:08:36.140

01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:53.528
<v Speaker 2>if I told you the story yet, but they used

01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:56.528

01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:59.959

01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:04.720

<v Speaker 1>crime lab had to check every packet and they thought

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:09:20.669 --> 01:09:23.298
<v Speaker 1>that was a waste of their time because, you know,

01:09:23.310 --> 01:09:25.640

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.799
<v Speaker 1>So, so here are the conditions, let's say that the

<v Speaker 3>probability that an event occurs in a certain interval is

<v Speaker 2>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

<v Speaker 1>So, you know, by that, I mean, let's say, you

01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:18.879

01:10:20.549 --> 01:10:25.009

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

<v Speaker 1>And so on, that's the sort of thing that we

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:38.819

<v Speaker 1>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:10:42.859 --> 01:10:46.390
<v Speaker 3>But notice there's, there's no sort of upper bound here,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[67,99,53,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:10:46.399 --> 01:10:50.779
<v Speaker 3>like with the binomial, you had end trials here here,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,96,99,99,98,99,99,99]}

01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:52.910
<v Speaker 3>this could go on to infinity.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,96]}

01:10:52.919 --> 01:10:54.259

01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:55.459

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,99,99,99]}

01:10:56.759 --> 01:11:01.410
<v Speaker 3>So the probability of X events occurring in a time

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,98,99]}

01:11:01.419 --> 01:11:07.470

01:11:13.459 --> 01:11:18.410
<v Speaker 3>equal to lambda, to the X, even the minus lambda

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,72,99,99,99,99,99,99,97]}

01:11:19.330 --> 01:11:20.799
<v Speaker 1>over X factor.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,93]}

01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:24.359
<v Speaker 3>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

01:11:24.370 --> 01:11:26.779
<v Speaker 3>So, so it's interesting that this comes up.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,96,99,94,99,99,99]}

01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:30.529

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:43.759
<v Speaker 2>So you can see here that E of X is

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,78,99,99,91,99,99,99,99]}

01:11:43.770 --> 01:11:44.450
<v Speaker 2>lambda.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97]}

01:11:44.799 --> 01:11:48.060
<v Speaker 2>And oddly enough, it's also the V of X.

01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:55.649

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

01:12:03.339 --> 01:12:05.830

<v Speaker 1>I want to think of this as a croissant lambda

01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:45.220

01:13:52.450 --> 01:13:55.109
<v Speaker 3>we didn't check the two here, we just look at,

01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Your lambda would be?

01:14:31.259 --> 01:14:35.759
<v Speaker 1>Not two because it sells on the average two a
