NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.599
<v Speaker 0>Um, there's two versions of the question, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.699

NOTE CONF {"raw":[90,92,93,63,98]}

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.120
<v Speaker 0>I don't, I don't think so.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[74,44,98,99,99,99]}

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:07.139

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:24.619
<v Speaker 0>these problems are these questions I've been trying, which have

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.839

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.809
<v Speaker 0>So you all get slightly different numbers with the same

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:38.050
<v Speaker 0>more issues.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:41.960
<v Speaker 0>Um And if I want to add those random number

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.949
<v Speaker 0>generations, I will master the quiz process first and then

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.720

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:02.899
<v Speaker 0>There's still plenty of time for it to be a

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.000
<v Speaker 0>the system and give you guys questions that actually work.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.339
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:20.800

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 0>have to admit embarrassingly, I did write that question, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:28.880
<v Speaker 0>I did spot it and then I deleted the wrong

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:29.210
<v Speaker 0>one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:33.410
<v Speaker 0>And then what happens is just like you guys, when

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.300

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,57]}

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.039
<v Speaker 0>Yeah, but we can actually reason this out the same

00:10:52.049 --> 00:10:54.080

<v Speaker 0>Each edge is on how many regions, two right, just

00:11:00.729 --> 00:11:04.200

<v Speaker 0>Why?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:11:16.309 --> 00:11:18.760
<v Speaker 0>Because if I count all the vertex degrees, then I

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:19.969

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

00:11:21.849 --> 00:11:25.690

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.659
<v Speaker 0>counts twice because it's on two regions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:16:11.669 --> 00:16:13.419
<v Speaker 0>Well, if it's only on one region, we just make

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,89,99,99]}

00:16:13.429 --> 00:16:15.130
<v Speaker 0>sure to count it twice on that region.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:16:15.409 --> 00:16:16.900
<v Speaker 0>And then the theorem still works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:16:18.169 --> 00:16:19.710
<v Speaker 0>This isn't gonna come up very often.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,96,99,99,99,99]}

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.440
<v Speaker 0>I just don't want to give you a theorem that's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[83,99,99,67,56,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:22.309
<v Speaker 0>only partially true.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.159
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[52,99]}

00:16:25.169 --> 00:16:27.340
<v Speaker 0>So I give you the theorem with the uh the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:16:27.349 --> 00:16:31.140
<v Speaker 0>weird exception that we count these dangly edges twice um

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.669
<v Speaker 0>on the region that they're in notice that I could

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:16:33.679 --> 00:16:36.679
<v Speaker 0>have just as easily drawn that dangly edge on the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:40.739
<v Speaker 0>outside, not on the inside, but it would really be

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:41.570
<v Speaker 0>the same graph, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.489
<v Speaker 0>It would just be transposing the inside region with the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.820
<v Speaker 0>outside region, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.780
<v Speaker 0>The outside would have degree six, the inside would have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:16:47.789 --> 00:16:48.330
<v Speaker 0>degree four.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:16:51.289 --> 00:16:53.229
<v Speaker 0>Now again, this is not really gonna come up for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,95,99,99,99]}

00:16:53.239 --> 00:16:55.169
<v Speaker 0>you guys, but just in case you ever see this

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:16:55.179 --> 00:16:57.559
<v Speaker 0>and to not give you a theorem that's uh only

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,96,99]}

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:58.609
<v Speaker 0>partially true, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:16:58.619 --> 00:16:59.909
<v Speaker 0>We cover all the cases.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.219
<v Speaker 0>Any question on this makes sense?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,76,99]}

00:17:03.599 --> 00:17:06.979
<v Speaker 0>Excellent, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:17:06.989 --> 00:17:09.380
<v Speaker 0>And like I said, why do we count the edge

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,87,92,98,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:10.380
<v Speaker 0>twice on the region?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:12.719
<v Speaker 0>Well, because we like this theorem.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:17:12.729 --> 00:17:14.900
<v Speaker 0>And so we count the edge twice on the region

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:16.329
<v Speaker 0>so that our theorem still works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:17:28.188 --> 00:17:32.829
<v Speaker 0>Now, I'm going to give you a corollary to euler's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,66,64,99,99,99,99,99,29]}

00:17:32.839 --> 00:17:33.520
<v Speaker 0>formula.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:17:34.479 --> 00:17:38.030
<v Speaker 0>Uh This is a very useful one in any connected

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.180
<v Speaker 0>planar graph.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[77,99]}

00:17:40.119 --> 00:17:43.729
<v Speaker 0>The number of edges must be less than three times

00:17:43.739 --> 00:17:45.380
<v Speaker 0>the number of vertices minus six.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 0>And I should, I, I think I should add a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:58.420
<v Speaker 0>caveat to this which is like e greater than um

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:03.369
<v Speaker 0>or you should give a cave out to this, which

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,90,94,99,99,99,87,99,99,99]}

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.780
<v Speaker 0>is where I have more than one region.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:18:12.839 --> 00:18:15.180
<v Speaker 0>I think this doesn't work quite right, if you have

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:18:15.189 --> 00:18:18.579
<v Speaker 0>just like a single edge in one region, but if

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:18:18.589 --> 00:18:19.520
<v Speaker 0>there's more than one region.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.250
<v Speaker 0>If I have a planar graph, this works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,96,93,99,99]}

00:18:24.609 --> 00:18:26.780
<v Speaker 0>So you guys have seen this before, some of you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:18:32.839 --> 00:18:34.939
<v Speaker 0>So OK, right now this is just an equation.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:18:34.949 --> 00:18:37.130
<v Speaker 0>Let me explain briefly why this works.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:18:37.239 --> 00:18:38.489
<v Speaker 0>And then we'll get into the proof.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:18:39.719 --> 00:18:41.300
<v Speaker 0>So let me draw a graph with some regions, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:42.449
<v Speaker 0>We need our greater than one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,51,99,99,99]}

00:18:42.459 --> 00:18:43.630
<v Speaker 0>So we need some regions.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.020
<v Speaker 0>How many edges do I need to make a region?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:18:48.569 --> 00:18:48.979
<v Speaker 0>Three?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:18:48.989 --> 00:18:49.150
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:54.790
<v Speaker 0>Three is the minimum, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

00:18:55.069 --> 00:18:59.219
<v Speaker 0>Two edges does not a region make, right, need one

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:18:59.229 --> 00:19:06.979
<v Speaker 0>more to close that loop, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:09.050
<v Speaker 0>And that's true, not just for this region but for

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:09.859
<v Speaker 0>every region.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:19:09.869 --> 00:19:10.260
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.780
<v Speaker 0>Right, we could have a region that has more than

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:18.079
<v Speaker 0>four, more than three rather but not less than three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:20.489
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[88]}

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.150
<v Speaker 0>So, so once I have two reasons, one thing I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,38,99,99,99]}

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.060
<v Speaker 0>know, right, what, what can I say about the degrees

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:19:28.069 --> 00:19:31.150
<v Speaker 0>of those regions right now that we know that these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.359
<v Speaker 0>are not just one dangly edge with a region, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,93,99,99]}

00:19:33.369 --> 00:19:36.859
<v Speaker 0>That these, these regions are completely bounded by a circuit.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.050
<v Speaker 0>What can I say about all of the regions of

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:40.359
<v Speaker 0>a plane?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,95]}

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.250
<v Speaker 0>The degrees three or more?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:45.550
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:50.569
<v Speaker 0>Three is the minimum degree that uh that a region

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,83,99,99,99]}

00:19:50.579 --> 00:19:53.939
<v Speaker 0>can have, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.729
<v Speaker 0>Can't be less, you can't have a region of degree

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,98,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:19:56.739 --> 00:19:57.170
<v Speaker 0>two.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.540
<v Speaker 0>You can only if you have that special case, right

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.060
<v Speaker 0>where the graph has just one edge, then you get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:02.069 --> 00:20:04.250
<v Speaker 0>a region of degree two, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:09.760
<v Speaker 0>But otherwise every region has degree of at least three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:12.359 --> 00:20:16.209
<v Speaker 0>And now we know right, that if we know something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:16.219 --> 00:20:18.219
<v Speaker 0>about the degrees of the regions, then we know something

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:18.229 --> 00:20:19.589
<v Speaker 0>about the number of edges.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:21.199 --> 00:20:22.849
<v Speaker 0>And that's, that's the gist of the proof.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:25.739 --> 00:20:27.689
<v Speaker 0>So let me bring up the proof here and we'll

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:27.699 --> 00:20:31.880
<v Speaker 0>go through it as we have just shown if I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:37.979
<v Speaker 0>add up the degrees of all of the regions, right,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:38.189 --> 00:20:40.670
<v Speaker 0>The minimum degree is three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.439
<v Speaker 0>And so every region must have a degree of at

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:45.449 --> 00:20:46.449
<v Speaker 0>least three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:20:46.459 --> 00:20:48.449
<v Speaker 0>And so if I add up all the degrees, that's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:48.459 --> 00:20:53.449
<v Speaker 0>at least three times the number of regions, everyone follow

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:53.459 --> 00:20:54.030
<v Speaker 0>line one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.989
<v Speaker 0>Any questions there, I think everything follows from line one.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.140
<v Speaker 0>Once you get line one good, once we know that,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.060
<v Speaker 0>well, what is the sum of the degrees of all

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:21:07.069 --> 00:21:07.689
<v Speaker 0>the regions?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:21:07.699 --> 00:21:11.060
<v Speaker 0>That's twice the number of edges, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:21:11.069 --> 00:21:12.969
<v Speaker 0>So we'll replace that the sum of the degrees of

00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:00.250

00:29:05.869 --> 00:29:09.060

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.030
<v Speaker 0>I'd have to, I'd have to think about that.

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:19.660

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:25.250
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,77]}

00:29:29.969 --> 00:29:34.500
<v Speaker 0>So now if only we had a tool, another tool

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:36.709
<v Speaker 0>that would help us with this K 33 problem and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,90,99,99]}

00:29:36.719 --> 00:29:39.219
<v Speaker 0>we do right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:29:42.329 --> 00:29:52.369
<v Speaker 0>But thankfully, we have another one, corollary number two, something

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.569
<v Speaker 0>else we can use.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

00:29:55.099 --> 00:30:00.790
<v Speaker 0>If G is, let me highlight here, a connected planar

<v Speaker 0>and bipartite graph, then we can actually establish a tighter

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,98,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:26.650
<v Speaker 0>proof.

<v Speaker 0>If I have a connected planar bipartite graph, well, we

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:35.140

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:35.959
<v Speaker 0>a one region.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,74]}

00:30:35.969 --> 00:30:39.810
<v Speaker 0>Uh example, let's assume that we have some boundary, some

NOTE CONF {"raw":[89,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:30:39.819 --> 00:30:41.319

00:30:41.469 --> 00:30:43.000

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.020
<v Speaker 0>We can have to mark a region.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.050
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[85,96]}

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.989
<v Speaker 0>The last example, we said three, right, I can make

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:55.829
<v Speaker 0>a region with three.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.670
<v Speaker 0>Why do you think three is not the answer anymore?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:06.170
<v Speaker 0>It's bipartite right, bipartite graph cannot have odd circuits.

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:11.869
<v Speaker 0>So if you can have odd circuits, then it can't

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,54,99,99,99,99,97,99,99]}

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:16.579

00:31:16.589 --> 00:31:37.569
<v Speaker 0>must be bounded by at least four, right, make a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,62]}

00:31:37.579 --> 00:31:44.540
<v Speaker 0>note, right, need four edges to bound.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[58,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.119
<v Speaker 0>So we just follow through the exact same reasoning only

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:55.739
<v Speaker 0>instead of each region being at least degree three, each

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.030
<v Speaker 0>And that gives us a nice tighter bound.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:04.000
<v Speaker 0>So now the sum of my degrees must be at

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:09.099
<v Speaker 0>least four are, and the rest of this is algebra,

00:32:09.109 --> 00:32:10.729

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:14.369
<v Speaker 0>Um The sum of the degrees is equal to two

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:02.989
<v Speaker 0>A path has no repeated vertices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:08.949
<v Speaker 0>A trail has no repeated edges, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:14.919
<v Speaker 0>A circuit is like a path but it closes on

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:39:14.929 --> 00:39:15.679
<v Speaker 0>itself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:39:17.129 --> 00:39:20.399
<v Speaker 0>A cycle is like a trail, right?

00:39:20.409 --> 00:39:22.600

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:28.139
<v Speaker 0>Um And with the caveat that by the way, today,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:39:28.149 --> 00:39:29.790
<v Speaker 0>we're gonna talk about oiler cycles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,95,99,99,99,99]}

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.409
<v Speaker 0>Guess what if you look it up on Wikipedia.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:39:31.419 --> 00:39:33.830
<v Speaker 0>What's it called Oiler Circuit, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.199
<v Speaker 0>The words are backwards in other books.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.510
<v Speaker 0>And I'm pretty sure Wikipedia follows that standard.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:39:40.389 --> 00:39:42.860
<v Speaker 0>So I'm gonna follow the wording in our textbook because

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,97,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:44.510
<v Speaker 0>that's what's in our book and what's in our notes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.520
<v Speaker 0>We just remember if we look it up elsewhere, we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:49.520
<v Speaker 0>might find the circuit and cycle definition switched.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,97,99,99]}

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:53.469
<v Speaker 0>Ok.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:39:53.479 --> 00:39:53.770
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:54.889
<v Speaker 0>Back to where we began.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:57.209
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:39:57.219 --> 00:40:01.360
<v Speaker 0>Seven bridges through Koenigsberg, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,52,99]}

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:05.689
<v Speaker 0>Can we walk over each bridge exactly once we know

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:40:05.699 --> 00:40:13.429
<v Speaker 0>that we can't, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

00:40:13.469 --> 00:40:17.459
<v Speaker 0>But now we're going to get into really why we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,98,66,64,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:40:17.469 --> 00:40:22.159
<v Speaker 0>can't let me see what I have here, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:40:22.169 --> 00:40:23.580
<v Speaker 0>So these are the questions on our minds.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,97]}

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:25.520
<v Speaker 0>Let me make the definition first.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:40:25.699 --> 00:40:28.649
<v Speaker 0>What we're looking for in this case is what we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:40:28.659 --> 00:40:30.580
<v Speaker 0>call the oiler cycle, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:33.899
<v Speaker 0>We're looking for a cycle through the graph with no

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:40:33.909 --> 00:40:34.979
<v Speaker 0>repeated edge, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:40:34.989 --> 00:40:38.350
<v Speaker 0>We don't cross any bridge twice and we want to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,98,98]}

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:44.219
<v Speaker 0>cover all the edges, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

00:40:44.229 --> 00:40:46.989
<v Speaker 0>So that is exactly what we call the oiler cycle,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:40:47.879 --> 00:40:48.219
<v Speaker 0>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:40:48.229 --> 00:40:51.959
<v Speaker 0>It is a cycle that is no edges repeated and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,93,99,99]}

00:40:51.969 --> 00:40:53.379
<v Speaker 0>it traverses every edge.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

00:40:58.159 --> 00:40:59.620
<v Speaker 0>And so one of the things you guys will mix

NOTE CONF {"raw":[66,57,99,99,95,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:40:59.629 --> 00:41:03.649
<v Speaker 0>up, um when I see your writing is cycle versus

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,98,99,99,99,99]}

00:41:03.659 --> 00:41:04.750
<v Speaker 0>oiler cycle, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:41:05.219 --> 00:41:08.030
<v Speaker 0>Anything that goes around in a cycle, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.830
<v Speaker 0>That uh doesn't repeat any edges is a cycle in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,97,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,93]}

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:14.030
<v Speaker 0>oiler cycle specifically covers every edge.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,92,99,99,99,99]}

00:41:25.889 --> 00:41:27.870
<v Speaker 0>So let's start by build some intuition.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:41:27.879 --> 00:41:30.760
<v Speaker 0>Look at some simple examples K five.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:31.790
<v Speaker 0>Do we have an oiler cycle?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,88,99]}

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:37.510
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:45.790

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.800
<v Speaker 0>a great example here because, because the structure of K

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:51.199
<v Speaker 0>You, you can't not find one, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:41:51.209 --> 00:41:55.070
<v Speaker 0>Just pick a vertex walk at random walk at random

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:06.570
<v Speaker 0>I'm not thinking very hard.

<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98]}

00:42:10.669 --> 00:42:13.620
<v Speaker 0>You start walking around, don't uh duplicate any edges.

00:42:21.469 --> 00:42:27.590
<v Speaker 0>And so I'll just say yes and many, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[69,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

00:42:27.739 --> 00:42:30.050

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:30.530
<v Speaker 0>want.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:31.729
<v Speaker 0>Walk around, you're gonna find it.

00:42:50.229 --> 00:42:54.959
<v Speaker 0>We've got an outside cycle and an inside cycle and

00:42:54.969 --> 00:42:56.479
<v Speaker 0>let me ask you guys, what did you find what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,63,99,99,96]}

00:42:56.489 --> 00:42:57.189
<v Speaker 0>you said it first?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,96,99]}

00:42:57.199 --> 00:42:57.810
<v Speaker 0>What did you find?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,66,99,99]}

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:07.399
<v Speaker 0>Start at F good B go around all the way

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:11.370

00:43:11.379 --> 00:43:14.010
<v Speaker 0>one, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:17.209
<v Speaker 0>So making sure you start on the middle, right?

00:43:17.219 --> 00:43:19.409

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:22.820
<v Speaker 0>We could of course, start on a, do the inside

00:49:51.399 --> 00:49:53.110
<v Speaker 0>So every time we do that degree goes down by

00:55:02.479 --> 00:55:02.989
<v Speaker 0>intuitive.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.090
<v Speaker 0>I think that if we have odd degree vertices, we

<v Speaker 0>Right?

00:55:35.889 --> 00:55:40.989

<v Speaker 0>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[61]}

00:55:48.169 --> 00:55:52.239

00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:38.139

<v Speaker 0>Let me go.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:30.899
<v Speaker 0>So the example I wanted to use for this proof

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:40.949
<v Speaker 0>So let me just uh copy this duplicate.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,96,99,99,99]}

00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:45.280

00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:42.850

00:58:51.010 --> 00:58:53.139

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:16.750
<v Speaker 0>edges yet.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:17.790
<v Speaker 0>So we have to do it again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:03:18.379 --> 01:03:22.080
<v Speaker 0>And so we pick any vertex that's left and we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:23.080
<v Speaker 0>wander, wander, wander.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,92,99]}

01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:24.629
<v Speaker 0>Um Let's do it in a different color.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,99,99,99,69,99,99,99]}

01:03:26.979 --> 01:03:29.199
<v Speaker 0>Let's get our blue one out, wander, wander wander.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,93,97,98]}

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:38.439
<v Speaker 0>And so I've expressed this graph as three cycles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,97,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:03:38.459 --> 01:03:41.560
<v Speaker 0>In this case, three in general, it could be one,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:43.800
<v Speaker 0>it could be 100 it could be any number.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:03:44.189 --> 01:03:47.459
<v Speaker 0>But by the rules that we're following each time we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:03:47.469 --> 01:03:49.719
<v Speaker 0>do this, we must create a cycle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:53.239
<v Speaker 0>And so we're going to decompose the graph into cycles,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,96,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:03:54.979 --> 01:03:55.439
<v Speaker 0>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.270
<v Speaker 0>There's some randomness in it, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.639
<v Speaker 0>I don't tell you how to choose the edges, how

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:04:00.649 --> 01:04:01.520
<v Speaker 0>to wander around.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:02.649
<v Speaker 0>But it doesn't matter.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.429
<v Speaker 0>You can always do it and you will always end

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,98,99,99]}

01:04:05.439 --> 01:04:09.139
<v Speaker 0>up with a result that is a decomposition of the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,86,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:04:09.149 --> 01:04:10.379
<v Speaker 0>graph into cycles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

01:04:11.199 --> 01:04:13.919
<v Speaker 0>Now, to complete the proof to show that we can

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:04:13.929 --> 01:04:17.620
<v Speaker 0>always make an oiler cycle, we're going to assemble these

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:04:19.219 --> 01:04:20.639
<v Speaker 0>into a single cycle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

01:04:22.709 --> 01:04:24.449
<v Speaker 0>Now, do you remember along the way I was kind

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,89]}

01:04:24.459 --> 01:04:26.639
<v Speaker 0>of pointing out like, well, we have this inside, we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,99,99,99,84,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:04:26.649 --> 01:04:29.179
<v Speaker 0>have these different cycles so we can kinda go from

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,73,99,99,97,99,99]}

01:04:29.189 --> 01:04:30.090

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

01:04:30.649 --> 01:04:33.489
<v Speaker 0>That's what we're gonna do, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,97,99,99]}

01:04:34.399 --> 01:04:38.290
<v Speaker 0>These cycles, let's pick any two cycles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:43.169
<v Speaker 0>Um, let's, we'll pick anyone to start with, let's start

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,34,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:04:43.179 --> 01:04:43.889

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

01:04:47.199 --> 01:04:50.979
<v Speaker 0>Now, the green cycle must intersect another cycle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:55.280
<v Speaker 0>How do I know it must intersect another cycle?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:04:58.260 --> 01:04:58.840
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:04.610
<v Speaker 0>Um, No, because that's actually true for every cycle, every

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:08.679
<v Speaker 0>cycle must intersect some other cycle, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:05:08.689 --> 01:05:11.590
<v Speaker 0>The purple one doesn't intersect the blue one, but every

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:22.610
<v Speaker 0>cycle intersects some other cycle cause it's connected, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,90,99,99,99]}

01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:25.149
<v Speaker 0>If I had a cycle that doesn't intersect any other

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:05:25.159 --> 01:05:30.409
<v Speaker 0>cycle, then the graph must be disconnected, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:05:30.419 --> 01:05:32.350
<v Speaker 0>There's no way to, how would I get from a

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.159
<v Speaker 0>vertex on this cycle to a vertex on that cycle?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:05:35.169 --> 01:05:36.959
<v Speaker 0>How would I get right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

01:05:36.969 --> 01:05:37.520
<v Speaker 0>To be connected?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:38.449
<v Speaker 0>There must be a path.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

01:05:38.459 --> 01:05:39.479
<v Speaker 0>Where's that path?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,99,99]}

01:05:41.229 --> 01:05:41.530
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:43.399
<v Speaker 0>It must be partly on one and partly on the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:05:43.409 --> 01:05:45.060
<v Speaker 0>other, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:46.810
<v Speaker 0>And so there must be a vertex in common.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:05:48.209 --> 01:05:49.389
<v Speaker 0>So that's the idea here.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:51.860
<v Speaker 0>So what am I gonna do?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,96,99]}

01:05:54.199 --> 01:05:57.639
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to pick one cycle to start with and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,90,91,99,99,99,99,99,99,74]}

01:05:57.649 --> 01:05:59.949
<v Speaker 0>I'm going to walk along it until I get to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[95,94,93,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:05:59.959 --> 01:06:04.800
<v Speaker 0>a vertex that's shared with another cycle, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,97,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:06.949
<v Speaker 0>So let's say for example, I pick a and I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:06:06.959 --> 01:06:08.639
<v Speaker 0>start going down my green cycle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.699
<v Speaker 0>Now I arrive at what is that ad?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,98,98,99,99]}

01:06:12.899 --> 01:06:13.209
<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:06:13.219 --> 01:06:14.719
<v Speaker 0>D is on green and purple.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:06:15.639 --> 01:06:18.939
<v Speaker 0>So what can we do from D, we can definitely

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:06:18.949 --> 01:06:25.080
<v Speaker 0>go around the purple cycle right back to D and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:06:25.090 --> 01:06:26.919
<v Speaker 0>then we can continue the green cycle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:33.219
<v Speaker 0>Good.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:06:35.639 --> 01:06:39.100
<v Speaker 0>Now, I have a new cycle that's green plus purple.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:06:41.169 --> 01:06:42.030
<v Speaker 0>That cycle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:45.129
<v Speaker 0>If there's any right, that cycle must intersect the next

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:06:45.139 --> 01:06:47.370
<v Speaker 0>one because it's connected.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,98,99]}

01:06:48.399 --> 01:06:49.790
<v Speaker 0>And so I do the same thing.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:52.219
<v Speaker 0>So now I walk around green plus purple.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:06:52.389 --> 01:06:53.739
<v Speaker 0>Do do right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.889
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96]}

01:06:54.899 --> 01:07:01.639
<v Speaker 0>I go a DC I, right, I go around purple,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,98,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:07:02.030 --> 01:07:03.919
<v Speaker 0>then I go around green and then when I get

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:07:03.929 --> 01:07:06.610
<v Speaker 0>to that shared vertex, H then I walk around the

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:09.750
<v Speaker 0>blue one and then I finish the right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.790
<v Speaker 0>And so I take all those cycles and I, I

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:15.310
<v Speaker 0>glue them together at their shared vertices.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:07:18.689 --> 01:07:20.429
<v Speaker 0>That's the idea of the proof.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:07:20.439 --> 01:07:21.739
<v Speaker 0>Now, all we have to do is write it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:28.719
<v Speaker 0>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:07:32.219 --> 01:07:38.699
<v Speaker 0>So this is how I've written it up, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:07:38.709 --> 01:07:41.669
<v Speaker 0>Given a connected graph G we'll start at some vertex

01:07:41.679 --> 01:07:47.639
<v Speaker 0>A and then from A, we will trace out a

01:07:47.649 --> 01:07:49.429
<v Speaker 0>trail, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

01:07:49.679 --> 01:07:52.739
<v Speaker 0>Any particular way we just keep on going and going

01:07:52.810 --> 01:07:54.760
<v Speaker 0>until we can't go anymore.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

01:07:56.550 --> 01:07:59.689
<v Speaker 0>Each degree being even means we will never be forced

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:07:59.699 --> 01:08:01.409
<v Speaker 0>to stop until we return to A.

01:08:01.419 --> 01:08:05.909
<v Speaker 0>So we must return to A, this gives us a

01:08:05.919 --> 01:08:11.969
<v Speaker 0>cycle C but not necessarily the oiler cycle, right?

<v Speaker 0>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:08:20.579 --> 01:08:26.490
<v Speaker 0>Now I do it again with G prime, which is

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:29.490

<v Speaker 0>Right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:30.669
<v Speaker 0>I take all those edges.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:37.008
<v Speaker 0>I start again.

01:08:49.869 --> 01:08:52.849
<v Speaker 0>That is the graph where I'm finding the second cycle,

01:08:54.619 --> 01:08:54.938
<v Speaker 0>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:08:54.949 --> 01:08:57.398
<v Speaker 0>So after I remove C from G, I have G

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:08:57.409 --> 01:08:59.909

<v Speaker 0>So I'm gonna make sure to start on that shared

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,90,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:09:02.719 --> 01:09:07.620

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:16.899
<v Speaker 0>If I go back here just for a second, right?

01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:19.100
<v Speaker 0>I could have done the green one first and then

<v Speaker 0>OK.

01:09:26.209 --> 01:09:27.919
<v Speaker 0>I could have done the purple one first and then

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:30.588

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

01:09:30.599 --> 01:09:31.749
<v Speaker 0>And then they wouldn't touch.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

01:09:31.757 --> 01:09:34.039
<v Speaker 0>So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make sure

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,97,99,99,99,98,99,99]}

01:09:34.047 --> 01:09:36.249

01:09:36.257 --> 01:09:38.769
<v Speaker 0>So that way my first cycle and my second cycle

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:09:38.777 --> 01:09:41.519

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:46.419

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:49.359

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99]}

01:10:01.089 --> 01:10:07.899
<v Speaker 0>Then I create a new circuit by following C from

01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:17.750

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.299
<v Speaker 0>Then I do the second cycle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:23.080

01:10:23.089 --> 01:10:25.669
<v Speaker 0>So I follow C from A to a prime C

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.500

<v Speaker 0>cycle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.390
<v Speaker 0>And then following C again, from a prime back to

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:10:33.399 --> 01:10:40.020

<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:07.549
<v Speaker 0>I subtract my cycle from the whole graph to see

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:08.939

01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:14.459

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:16.120

01:11:16.129 --> 01:11:18.180

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,98,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:21.370

<v Speaker 0>so I can upload the lectures through the virtual sync

01:13:34.109 --> 01:13:36.240
<v Speaker 0>figured out how to download them to share them with

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:36.399
<v Speaker 0>you.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:38.250
<v Speaker 0>I'll get that fixed as soon as I can.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:39.430
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:13:45.899 --> 01:13:47.319
<v Speaker 0>The code on the Duo app.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:13:54.359 --> 01:13:56.500
<v Speaker 0>Um Can you show me after class?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:56.890
<v Speaker 0>Yeah.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:13:58.169 --> 01:13:59.569
<v Speaker 0>Um OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:00.609
<v Speaker 0>We only have five minutes left.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:01.509
<v Speaker 0>So let's do real quick.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.040
<v Speaker 0>Uh Let's see.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[97,99,99]}

01:14:02.049 --> 01:14:06.439
<v Speaker 0>I think that's right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

01:14:07.770 --> 01:14:08.790
<v Speaker 0>Or their cycles.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[91,51,99]}

01:14:08.799 --> 01:14:11.470
<v Speaker 0>Examples, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

01:14:16.609 --> 01:14:19.250
<v Speaker 0>Those are the easy ones, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,95,99,99,99,99]}

01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:22.600
<v Speaker 0>We already saw this one, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:14:22.609 --> 01:14:23.279
<v Speaker 0>No.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:25.819
<v Speaker 0>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:26.330
<v Speaker 0>What do you guys think?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

01:14:26.339 --> 01:14:26.930
<v Speaker 0>Next one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:35.250
<v Speaker 0>No, next one now, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

01:14:35.319 --> 01:14:36.439
<v Speaker 0>Um I'll highlight these.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

01:14:36.450 --> 01:14:37.819
<v Speaker 0>Here's our degree threes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,97]}

01:14:37.839 --> 01:14:40.100
<v Speaker 0>Uh Here's our degree threes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,99,99,97]}

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:42.720
<v Speaker 0>Here they are, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

01:14:44.339 --> 01:14:47.600
<v Speaker 0>Any two, even if there's one odd degree vertex there.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,98,99,99,98,99,99,99,99,63]}

01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:48.959
<v Speaker 0>Well, there's no such thing, right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:14:49.379 --> 01:14:49.839
<v Speaker 0>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:14:50.919 --> 01:14:51.899
<v Speaker 0>Uh How about this one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[81,99,99,99,99]}

01:14:53.879 --> 01:14:54.479
<v Speaker 0>Yes.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:57.160
<v Speaker 0>Um oh By the way, um do I have it

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,96,99,99,99,99]}

01:14:57.169 --> 01:14:58.419
<v Speaker 0>on the original theorem?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

01:15:01.319 --> 01:15:04.009
<v Speaker 0>Um I didn't write it but it's it.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.819
<v Speaker 0>Um I'll make a note for next time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:15:06.109 --> 01:15:10.370
<v Speaker 0>Um This theorem for O cycles holds for multi graphs,

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,89,99,99,99,99,10]}

01:15:13.419 --> 01:15:13.720
<v Speaker 0>right?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:15:13.729 --> 01:15:15.490
<v Speaker 0>This is not just for, for graphs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.120
<v Speaker 0>This holds for multi graphs.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,23]}

01:15:18.439 --> 01:15:20.879
<v Speaker 0>I believe it also holds for pseudo gras, although it's

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,91,0,99,99]}

01:15:20.890 --> 01:15:23.220
<v Speaker 0>kind of silly to talk about cycles on a pseudograph

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,98,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:15:23.229 --> 01:15:25.020
<v Speaker 0>because you can have a cycle to yourself.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:30.629
<v Speaker 0>Uh So here we do have a multi graph, but

NOTE CONF {"raw":[87,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,0,99]}

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.640
<v Speaker 0>this one works, right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:39.040
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:15:39.049 --> 01:15:40.310
<v Speaker 0>I draw without picking up my pen.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:15:41.439 --> 01:15:41.810
<v Speaker 0>OK.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:15:41.819 --> 01:15:43.540
<v Speaker 0>This one we know this one works great.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:15:46.069 --> 01:15:47.129
<v Speaker 0>And what was the last one?

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,96,67,99,99,99]}

01:15:48.450 --> 01:15:48.839
<v Speaker 0>All right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[96,96]}

01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:50.080
<v Speaker 0>Multi graph again.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,0,99]}

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:52.040
<v Speaker 0>But this one works just fine.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:55.930
<v Speaker 0>In fact, if it works, it almost doesn't matter what

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:15:55.939 --> 01:15:56.640
<v Speaker 0>I do.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:57.799
<v Speaker 0>I just have to be careful.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:15:57.810 --> 01:16:00.310
<v Speaker 0>I don't, um, cut off a whole cycle.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,98,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:16:01.229 --> 01:16:01.500
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:16:01.509 --> 01:16:03.629
<v Speaker 0>And if I do, I get back to the beginning

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:05.359
<v Speaker 0>and I go, oh, I cut off a cycle and

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:16:05.370 --> 01:16:07.109
<v Speaker 0>then I glue the cycles together like we did in

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:07.600
<v Speaker 0>the proof.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,97]}

01:16:10.089 --> 01:16:10.589
<v Speaker 0>Ok.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:12.540
<v Speaker 0>I think that's good for today.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:16:12.549 --> 01:16:14.009
<v Speaker 0>We'll pick up next time.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99,99]}

01:16:14.029 --> 01:16:15.990
<v Speaker 0>We'll cover oiler trails.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[98,99,99,99]}

01:16:16.339 --> 01:16:16.620
<v Speaker 0>Right.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:16:16.629 --> 01:16:17.500
<v Speaker 0>Same idea.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99]}

01:16:17.509 --> 01:16:18.779
<v Speaker 0>Hit all the edges.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,99,99,99]}

01:16:19.129 --> 01:16:20.600
<v Speaker 0>But, uh, we don't have to go back where we

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,92,99,99,99,99,99,99,99,99]}

01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:21.140
<v Speaker 0>started.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99]}

01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:26.430
<v Speaker 0>So, this is ok.

NOTE CONF {"raw":[99,24,17,0]}
